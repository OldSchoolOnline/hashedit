# Hashedit (or #edit)

Hashedit is a framework agnostic WYSIWYG editor for static web sites.  The idea for Hashedit came from a notion that "wouldn't it be cool if you could just append #edit to any HTML page to edit it".  Hashedit supports inline rich text editing; the creation and destruction of HTML blocks (and elements); editing of links and images; and drag-and-drop reordering powered by the fantastic Sortable Library.  Hashedit is built in plain JS with just the Sortable dependency.  

Hashedit is part of a larger effort to provide a comprehensive Node JS framework to make the #edit notion a reality.  You can following the other repositories for this effort here:
